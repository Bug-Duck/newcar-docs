# Configuration
First, you need to install the newcar kernel package

```shell
$ npm install newcar/@core
```

The reference list is as follows

```
Project
| node_ modules
| src
| index.js
| index.html
| public
```

# Initialize
First, let's create a newcar animation object `Car`

```javascript
// src/index.js
import { newcar } from "./node_modules/@newcar/core/dist/index.js";
const { Car } = newcar;
const animation = new Car(document.getElementById("animation"), 60);
```

The first parameter is the dom object of the canvas element, and the second parameter is the number of frames of the animation
Then, import it in `index. html`

```html
<!-- index.html-->
<script src="./src/index.js"></script>
<body>
  <canvas id="animation" width="800" height="450"></canvas>
</body>
```

But the current animation has not yet started, so we need to start playing it

```javascript
animation.startPlay();
```

Now animation has run in theory, but there is nothing on the canvas, so we need to add something to the canvas
