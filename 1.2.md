# Define animated objects
The next step is to display something on the screen.

We need to display "Hello world!" on the screen

First of all, let's learn about newcar's component library `newcar.object`, which contains various components. What we need to use is `Text`

```javascript
import { newcar } from "./node_modules/@newcar/core/dist/index.js";
const { Car } = newcar;
const { Text } = newcar.object;
const text = new Text({
  x: 200,
  y: 100,
  text: "Hello world!",
});
const animation = new Car(document.getElementById("animation"), 60);
animation.addObject(text);
animation.startPlay();
```

Then you will see a character on the screen

For more parameters and components of Text, see [Component List](/zh-cn/2.1.md)
